# credit-risk-classification
Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In the 'credi-risk-classification' you should find:
* The "Credit Risk Analysis" report
* Jupyter Notebook 'credit_risk_classification' containing all the code ran for analysis
* the Resources folder, which contains the lending data, 'lending_data.csv'
